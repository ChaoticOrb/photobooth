# photobooth
Photo booth programme for use with picamera.

This was put together to be used as a DIY wedding photo booth to avoid the ridiculous costs of hiring a DLSR in a box.

## requirements:
* **raspberry pi** - this was built with a [Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-zero-w/) W but you could easily use a Raspberry Pi 3. Having built in wifi makes set up and running it much easier.
* **Pi Camera Module v2** - the [second version](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2/) of the Pi Camera module with a Pi Zero cable. [Read the docs](https://picamera.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.13/)

## usage
